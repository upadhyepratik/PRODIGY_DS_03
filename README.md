# PRODIGY_DS_03
I'm thrilled to announce that I have successfully completed another significant task during my Data Science Internship at @Prodigy InfoTech.

This task involved building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. I used the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository for this task.

Key Features Implemented in the Task:

‚óè **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure it was ready for model training.

‚óè **Model Building**: Built a decision tree classifier, a powerful machine learning algorithm for classification tasks.

‚óè **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics to ensure its predictive accuracy.

About the Task:
This task allowed me to delve deep into the world of machine learning and data analysis. From data preprocessing to model evaluation, each step was a learning experience that highlighted the importance of data in decision-making processes.

I'm excited to continue my journey in data science and look forward to sharing more of my experiences with you. Feel free to share your thoughts or experiences with decision tree classifiers or data science in general below! Let's keep the data conversation going.üìä
